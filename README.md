# PS Multi Tools
Backup manager for PS1, PS2, PSX, PS3, PS4 &amp; PS5 (later), PSP &amp; PS Vita.</br>
Includes homebrew, firmwares, Windows tools downloads and integrated tools for all mentioned consoles and handhelds.

## v1-12
All Builds below v13 are not working properly anymore due to the mising "ps-menu.dll" that doesn't exist anymore.</br>
It deletes "ps-menu.dll" and tries to download the latest version but the old server is not available anymore.

## PS Menu Library
The "PS Menu" is the top menu of every single window in PS Multi Tools that contains the tools & downloads. (PS Multi Tools will only act as backup manager without it.)</br>
Like in the previous releases, PS Multi Tools will load the latest available tools & downloads from the "psmt-lib.dll" library.</br>
The source code can be found in the other repository: [PSMT Library](https://github.com/SvenGDK/PSMT-Library)
